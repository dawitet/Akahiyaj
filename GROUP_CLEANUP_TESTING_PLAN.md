# Group Cleanup Testing Plan

## üéØ Objective
Clean up all existing groups from Firebase and test the 30-minute group cleanup functionality from a fresh slate.

## üìã Step-by-Step Cleanup & Testing Process

### Phase 1: Manual Cleanup (Choose ONE method)

#### Method 1: Firebase Console (Easiest) ‚≠ê
1. **Go to Firebase Console**:
   - Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your `Akahidegn` project

2. **Navigate to Realtime Database**:
   - Click "Realtime Database" in the left sidebar
   - Find the `groups` node in your database

3. **Delete All Groups**:
   - Click the "‚ãÆ" (three dots) next to `groups`
   - Select "Delete" to remove all groups at once
   - Confirm deletion

#### Method 2: App Debug Menu (Recommended for Testing)
1. **Build and Install App**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/dawitsahle/AndroidStudioProjects/Akahidegn
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   /Users/dawitsahle/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```

2. **Open Debug Menu**:
   - Open the app
   - Navigate to Debug Menu (if available in main menu)
   - Or add debug functionality to settings

3. **Mass Delete Groups**:
   - Click "üî• MASS DELETE ALL GROUPS" button
   - Monitor logs: `adb logcat | grep GroupCleanupDebug`
   - Verify deletion completion in logs

#### Method 3: Firebase CLI
1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Run Cleanup Script**:
   ```bash
   ./firebase_cli_cleanup.sh
   ```
   - Choose option 1 to view current groups
   - Choose option 3 to backup groups first
   - Choose option 2 to delete all groups

### Phase 2: Verify Cleanup Complete

1. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Verify `groups` node is empty or doesn't exist

2. **Check App**:
   - Open app and verify no groups are displayed
   - Use debug menu "Log All Groups with Timestamps"

### Phase 3: Test Group Cleanup Functionality

#### 3.1 Create Test Groups
1. **Create Multiple Test Groups**:
   - Use debug menu "Create Test Group" button (create 3-5 groups)
   - Or create groups manually through the app

2. **Verify Groups Created**:
   - Check Firebase Console to see new groups
   - Note their timestamps
   - Use "Log All Groups with Timestamps" in debug menu

#### 3.2 Test Immediate Cleanup (Simulated)
1. **Create Old Test Group**:
   - Temporarily modify `createTestGroup()` to use old timestamp:
   ```kotlin
   val oldTimestamp = System.currentTimeMillis() - (35 * 60 * 1000) // 35 minutes ago
   ```

2. **Test Cleanup Detection**:
   - Use "üßπ Delete Old Groups (30+ min)" button
   - Check logs to verify old groups are identified and deleted

#### 3.3 Test Automatic Cleanup
1. **Create Fresh Groups**:
   - Create 2-3 new groups with current timestamps

2. **Wait for Natural Expiration**:
   - Option A: Wait 30+ minutes (slow but real test)
   - Option B: Use "üßπ Delete Old Groups (1+ min)" for faster testing

3. **Trigger Cleanup**:
   - Use "Trigger Immediate Cleanup" button
   - Check logs for cleanup results

### Phase 4: Monitor & Verify

#### 4.1 Check Logs
Monitor these log tags:
```bash
# Main cleanup logs
adb logcat | grep -E "(GroupCleanupDebug|GroupCleanupWorker|FirebaseGroupService)"

# Specific cleanup events
adb logcat | grep "MASS DELETION\|cleanup\|expired"
```

#### 4.2 Expected Log Output
```
GroupCleanupDebug: Found X groups to delete
GroupCleanupDebug: ‚úÖ Successfully deleted: [group info]
GroupCleanupDebug: üî• MASS DELETION COMPLETED!
GroupCleanupWorker: Successfully cleaned up X expired groups
```

#### 4.3 Verify in Firebase
- Check Firebase Console to confirm groups are deleted
- Verify only active (recent) groups remain

### Phase 5: Long-term Testing

#### 5.1 Test Automatic Scheduling
1. **Create Groups**: Add 2-3 groups through normal app usage
2. **Monitor Over Time**: Check if groups are automatically cleaned after 30 minutes
3. **Check WorkManager**: Verify background cleanup is working

#### 5.2 Test Edge Cases
- Groups with missing timestamps
- Groups created by different users
- App backgrounded/killed scenarios

## üö® Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- Mass deletion is **PERMANENT** - no undo
- Backup groups before deletion if needed
- Test on development environment first

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ Groups older than 30 minutes should be deleted
- ‚úÖ Active groups (< 30 minutes) should remain
- ‚úÖ Cleanup should run automatically every 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Manual cleanup should work immediately

### Troubleshooting
If cleanup doesn't work:
1. Check Firebase security rules (users can only delete their own groups)
2. Verify WorkManager is scheduled properly
3. Check network connectivity requirements
4. Monitor for Firebase authentication issues

## üìä Success Criteria

‚úÖ All old groups successfully deleted manually  
‚úÖ New test groups created and visible  
‚úÖ Old test groups identified correctly  
‚úÖ Cleanup deletes expired groups only  
‚úÖ Recent groups remain untouched  
‚úÖ Automatic cleanup scheduling works  
‚úÖ Debug tools provide clear feedback  

## üîß Debug Tools Available

1. **üî• MASS DELETE ALL GROUPS** - Nuclear option, deletes everything
2. **üßπ Delete Old Groups (1+ min)** - Quick test with 1-minute threshold
3. **üßπ Delete Old Groups (30+ min)** - Normal 30-minute cleanup
4. **Trigger Immediate Cleanup** - Test WorkManager cleanup
5. **Log All Groups with Timestamps** - View current state
6. **Create Test Group** - Add test data

Ready to start the cleanup and testing process!
