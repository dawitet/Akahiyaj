# Phone-Based Contact System Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully transformed the Akahidegn Android app from a chat-based system to a phone-based contact system. Users now register with their name, phone number, and avatar selection. After joining a group, members can view each other's contact details and call directly through the app.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. User Registration System
- **Required Fields**: Name, phone number, avatar selection
- **Avatar Options**: 8 predefined avatar options (avatar_1 through avatar_8)
- **Storage**: Both local (SharedPreferences) and Firebase
- **Validation**: Name length (1-50 chars), phone format validation

### 2. Group Member Contact System
- **Contact Visibility**: Phone numbers only visible after joining a group
- **Member Information**: Name, phone, avatar, join timestamp
- **Creator Identification**: Group creator marked with a star (⭐)
- **Direct Calling**: Click-to-call functionality for phone numbers
- **Member Dialog**: Clean UI showing all group member details

### 3. Data Structure Changes
- **Group Model**: Added `memberDetails` HashMap storing `MemberInfo` objects
- **MemberInfo**: Contains name, phone, avatar, joinedAt timestamp
- **User Profile**: Stored in Firebase under `/users/$uid` with name, phone, avatar, registrationTime, lastActive

### 4. Firebase Integration
- **Database Rules**: Updated to support new data structure with validation
- **Security**: Phone validation regex, avatar format validation, name length limits
- **Member Details Storage**: Stored in group's `memberDetails` field
- **User Profile Storage**: Complete user profiles in `/users/$uid`

```
