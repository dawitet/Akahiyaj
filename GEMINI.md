# Akahidegn App Analysis (Exhaustive)

## Update summary — Aug 9, 2025

- Modules: settings now include `:app` and `:benchmark` (Macrobenchmark test module).
- Recent changes:
	- AnimationSequencer wired into AnimationViewModel for group-create celebration.
	- ConfettiEmitter (Canvas particle overlay) added and overlaid in MainActivity; triggered via a state key.
	- PhysicsAnimations updated to return `SpringSpec<Float>`; fixed Compose spring type inference errors.
	- Resource stability: added default `auto_join_enabled` in `values/strings.xml` and removed the localized duplicate.
	- Manifest: added `<profileable android:shell="true" />` to allow Macrobenchmark profiling.
	- Macrobenchmark harness: `benchmark` module with self-instrumenting; `StartupBenchmark` measures cold startup; `connectedDebugAndroidTest` runs on emulator.
- Build & run:
	- App assembles after fixes; installed and launched via adb.
	- Macrobenchmark connected test executes successfully.
- Next steps:
	- Expand AnimationSequencer to join/leave/disband flows; keep steps named and measurable.
	- Establish Macrobenchmark baselines (JSON) and wire into CI.
	- Define policy for locale-only strings vs. defaults to reduce warnings.
	- Make ad-gate deterministic in debug for E2E tests.
- Known warnings:
	- Some “removing resource … without required default value” logs remain for locale-only strings; non-blocking but can be silenced with neutral defaults.

This document provides a detailed analysis of the Akahidegn app, including its structure, dependencies, backend, frontend, and development/automation scripts. It also identifies inconsistencies, warnings, and unused files.
