Recap and Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Google Sign-In Provider Enabled in Firebase:** Done.\n2.  **Release SHA-1 Added to Firebase App Config:** Done.\n3.  **New \`google-services.json\` Downloaded and Replaced:** Done.\n4.  **Web Client ID Created in Google Cloud Console:** Done, and this is a big step!\n5.  **\`strings.xml\` Updated with Correct Web Client ID:** Done.\n6.  **App Check SDK Added and Initialized:** Done (including Play Integrity for release and Debug provider factory in code).\n\n**Crucial Actions Remaining for App Check (Debug):**\n\n*   Run a DEBUG build of your app on an emulator or a physical test device.\n*   Look in Logcat (filter for "FirebaseAppCheck") for a message that looks like this:\n    \`D/FirebaseAppCheck: Enter this debug secret into the Firebase console: XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\`\n*   Copy this debug token.\n*   Go to your **Firebase Console -> Build -> App Check -> Apps tab**.\n*   Click on your app (\`com.dawitf.akahidegn\`).\n*   Go to the **"Attestation providers"** section.\n*   You should see Play Integrity already registered. Click **"Add debug token"** (or it might be under a "Debug" provider section you can add/manage).\n*   Paste the debug token you copied from Logcat and save it.\n\n**Why is the debug token critical?**\n\nEven with Play Integrity configured for release, when you are running debug builds (e.g., deploying directly from Android Studio to an emulator or connected device), App Check might still require a valid token. If Play Integrity can\'t fully attest (common on emulators), the debug token acts as a valid stand-in, preventing App Check failures for your debug sessions.\n\n**After setting up the debug token:**\n\n1.  Clean and Rebuild your project in Android Studio.\n2.  Run your app again (debug mode) and try Google Sign-In.\n\nPlease let me know how it goes after you\'ve added the debug token and tested again! We\'ve made significant progress on the configuration front.
