## Pending Improvements ðŸ”„

### User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add sound effects option alongside haptic feedback (placeholder implemented)
- [ ] Add gradient background support (lightweight layered Box)

### Integration Improvements
- [ ] Localize remaining minor hardcoded strings (dialogs, toasts in MainActivity)
- [ ] Add RTL layout support

### Advanced Animation Features
- [ ] Implement sequential animation chain for multiple success states
- [ ] Create animation sequencing system (builder + timeline)
- [ ] Add gesture-based animation triggers
- [ ] Implement shared element transitions (Compose Navigation experimental)
- [ ] Add physics-based animations (spring-based decay / splines)
- [ ] Add particle effects for celebrations (custom Canvas emitter)
- [ ] Add (optional) Lottie animation support (defer until assets available)

### Testing & Tooling
- [ ] Create component documentation with examples (md + @Preview catalogue)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking (Macrobenchmark / Frame metrics)
- [ ] Implement accessibility instrumentation tests
- [ ] Add animation debugging tools (overlay showing durations / jank)

### Localization & Internationalization
- [ ] Implement locale-specific animations (reduced motion variants)
- [ ] Add cultural color preferences (palette toggle)
- [ ] Create region-specific haptic patterns

## Priority Levels
ðŸ”´ **High Priority**: Final string extraction (dialogs/toasts), sound effects toggle, sequential animation chain
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority**: Animation sequencing system, RTL support, performance benchmarking
ðŸŸ¢ **Low Priority**: Particle effects, physics animations, Lottie (pending assets), shared element transitions

## Next Steps (Reordered)
1. Finish extracting remaining toast/dialog strings
2. Implement sound effects preference + simple click sound
3. Build minimal sequential animation chain utility
4. Add gradient background helper (optional polish)
5. Add RTL & accessibility instrumentation tests scaffolding

## Latest Achievements ðŸš€
- Profile & Activity History screens integrated + localized
- Activity history logging on create/join events
- Localization pass removed primary hardcoded strings
- Deprecated enhanced screen removed; codebase leaner
- Minimal search bar implemented replacing empty file
