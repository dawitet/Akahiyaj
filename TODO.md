// Recent completions
- [x] AnimationSequencer wired into AnimationViewModel (runGroupCreateSequence, presets)
- [x] Confetti particle effects integrated (Canvas-based ConfettiEmitter overlay)
- [x] Physics spring presets fixed (type-safe SpringSpec<Float>)
- [x] Macrobenchmark harness added (StartupTimingMetric), profileable manifest enabled
- [x] Resolved resource duplication (added default for auto_join_enabled)

## Pending Improvements ðŸ”„

### User Experience Enhancements
- [x] Add sound effects option alongside haptic feedback (basic toggle + success tone)
- [x] Add gradient background support (lightweight layered Box)

### Integration Improvements
- [x] Localize remaining minor hardcoded strings (dialogs, toasts in MainActivity)

### Advanced Animation Features
- [x] Implement sequential animation chain for multiple success states (minimal utility)
- [x] Create animation sequencing system (builder + timeline)
- [x] Add gesture-based animation triggers
- [ ] Implement shared element transitions (Compose Navigation experimental)
- [x] Add physics-based animations (spring-based decay / splines)
- [x] Add particle effects for celebrations (custom Canvas emitter)


## Priority Levels
ðŸ”´ **High Priority**: Final string extraction (dialogs/toasts), sequential animation chain adoption across flows
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority**: Animation sequencing extensions, RTL support, shared element transitions
ðŸŸ¢ **Low Priority**: Particle effects, physics animations, Lottie (pending assets), shared element transitions



## Latest Achievements ðŸš€
- Profile & Activity History screens integrated + localized
- Activity history logging on create/join events
- Localization pass removed primary hardcoded strings
- Deprecated enhanced screen removed; codebase leaner
- Minimal search bar implemented replacing empty file
- Confetti celebrations overlayed in MainActivity; triggered via AnimationViewModel
- Macrobenchmark module stabilized; connected test executes on emulator
- Compose spring generics fixed (no inference errors)
- Resource merge stabilized (no duplicate key for auto_join_enabled)
