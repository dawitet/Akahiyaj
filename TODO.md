## Priority Levels
ðŸ”´ **High Priority**: Final string extraction (dialogs/toasts), sequential animation chain adoption across flows
ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority**: Animation sequencing extensions, RTL support, shared element transitions
ðŸŸ¢ **Low Priority**: Particle effects, physics animations, Lottie (pending assets), shared element transitions



## Latest Achievements ðŸš€
- Profile & Activity History screens integrated + localized
- Activity history logging on create/join events
- Localization pass removed primary hardcoded strings
- Deprecated enhanced screen removed; codebase leaner
- Minimal search bar implemented replacing empty file
- Confetti celebrations overlayed in MainActivity; triggered via AnimationViewModel
- Macrobenchmark module stabilized; connected test executes on emulator
- Compose spring generics fixed (no inference errors)
- Resource merge stabilized (no duplicate key for auto_join_enabled)
